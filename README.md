# Fiyel Bet - Goat House

A modern Next.js frontend for Fiyel Bet, an authentic Ethiopian restaurant specializing in grilled goat meat (Tibs).

## Design Concept

**The Horns & The Flame (Culinary Focus)**
- Circular logo resembling a charcoal grill (Midija)
- Goat horns created with negative space
- Stylized red/orange flame between the horns
- Heavy, blocky typography with stamped/branded effect
- Subtle Ethiopian Tibeb (woven pattern) border
- Hot, sizzling, energetic vibe

## Color Palette

- **Clay/Terracotta** (#C97D60, #B85C38): Representing Shekla (clay pots) and Berbere
- **Charcoal Grey** (#2C2C2C, #3A3A3A): Representing Midija (charcoal grill) and fire
- **Deep Green & Gold** (#1B5E20, #D4AF37): Nods to Ethiopian flag and fresh spices
- **Straw/Beige** (#E8D5B7, #F5E6D3): Representing Tukul (thatched roof) and Injera
- **Flame Colors** (#FF4500, #FF6B35): Hot, energetic flame effects
